=head1 NAME

Test::More::Strict - Enforce policies on test results

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Test::More::Strict version 0.03

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.03';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Enforce non-blank test description
    use Test::More::Strict description => sub {
        my $desc = shift;
        return defined $desc and $desc =~ /\S/;
    };
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Test::More::Strict> allows policies for test results to be enforced.
For example you may require that all tests have a non-blank description.
You could achieve that like this:

    # Enforce non-blank test description
    use Test::More::Strict description => sub {
        my $desc = shift;
        return defined $desc and $desc =~ /\S/;
    };

In general you pass a number of key => coderef pairs on the use line.
Currently the only recognised key is C<description>. The coderef is
called with the test description as its first argument. It should return
a true value if the description is OK otherwise false.

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 C<< caller >>

Overridden from Test::Builder. Adjusts the stack depth to account for
our intercept.

=cut

# Fix up caller
sub caller {
    my ( $self, $height ) = @_;
    $height ||= 0;
    return $self->SUPER::caller( $height + 2 );
}

=head2 C<< ok >>

Overridden from Test::Builder.

=cut

sub ok {
    my ( $self, $test, $description ) = @_;
    return $self->SUPER::ok(
        _and_with_handlers( 'description', $test, $description ),
        $description );
}

sub _and_with_handlers {
    my ( $event, $ok, @args ) = @_;
    return $ok unless $ok;
    for my $handler ( @{ $Handler{$event} || [] } ) {
        return 0 unless $handler->( @args );
    }
    return $ok;
}

{
    my %OK_EVENT = map { $_ => 1 } @OK_EVENT;

    sub import {
        my $class = shift;

        croak "Please supply a number of key => value pairs"
          if @_ & 1;

        while ( my ( $event, $validator ) = splice @_, 0, 2 ) {
            croak "$event is not a valid event name"
              unless $OK_EVENT{$event};
            croak "Validator must be a code reference"
              unless 'CODE' eq ref $validator;
            push @{ $Handler{$event} }, $validator;
        }
    }
}
